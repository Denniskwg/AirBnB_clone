# AirBnB clone - The console

## Description
This project is an AirBnB clone which starts off as a console app and will gradually be developed to a web application with limited features as compared to the real AirBnB web app. Parts to be built with time include:

- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging) (Current Repository)
- A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
- A database or files that store data (data = objects)
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

## About the console (command intepreter)
### Starting..
To start the console app you'll need to run/execute the file `$ ./console.py`. If successful you'll be presented with a prompt on loop to run commands from.

### Using the console...
You can start using the app by running basic commands. To get a list of commands that you can run you'll start off by running `?` from the running prompt which will list all available commands. Use the `help command` to get help on how to use a specific command.

### Some examples..
```
(airbnb) ?

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
